# Django Web Image Placeholder (WIP)

Inspired by [placehold.it](http://placehold.it/) WIP (pronounced "work in progress") is a simple Django app delivering placeholder images for Web designers and developers.

This application has been developed in a "30 Minutes Situation", where placehold.it went down and all our design-prototypes stopped working properly. By "30 Minutes" I literally mean "1800s" so please DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING from this tool. It works for our purpose but certainly contains bugs, security issues and performance is laughable. **Thus, feel free to fork, fix and commit back â€“ I love PRs!**

## Installation

Please refer to the official Django documentation on how to deploy Django applications.

Note that WIP requires a font named "Courier New.ttf" and "FontAwesome.otf" in an accessible path.

You should succeed with a little background knowledge by following these steps:

Install Django on the Development System.

1. create a Virtual Environment ```virtual-env YOURENVNAME``` and...
2. ...activate it ```source YOURENVNAME/bin/active```.
3. install required packages into the new venv (pip recommended) ```pip install Django Pillow```
4. create a Django Project ```django-admin startproject YOURNAME```
5. clone the repository into the new Django project ```git clone URL-TO-THIS-REPO```
6. modify _settings.py_ by add ```imagegen``` to your ```INSTALLED_APPS```
7. add ```url(r'^', include('imagegen.urls')),``` to your _urls.py_
8. start the development-server ```./manage.py runserver``` _(There are no models for this app, thus no migrations needed)_


Done: App can be reached at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

If you want to run this on a public server READ DJANGO'S DOCUMENTATION! Also, I highly recommend any sort of caching mechanism if you're going to run this and expect some load. But anyways READ THE DJANGO-DOCS ;-)
