# Django Web Image Placeholder (WIP)

Inspired by [placehold.it](http://placehold.it/) WIP (pronounced "work in progress") is a simple Django app delivering placeholder images for Web designers and developers.

This application has been developed in a "30 Minutes Situation", where placehold.it went down and all our design-prototypes stopped working properly. By "30 Minutes" I literally mean "1800s" so please DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING from this tool. It works for our purpose but certainly contains bugs, security issues and performance is laughable. **Thus, feel free to fork, fix and commit back â€“ I love PRs!**

## Installation

Please refer to the official Django documentation on how to deploy Django applications.

Note that WIP requires a font named "Courier New.ttf" installed on your system.

You should succeed with a little background knowledge by following these steps:

Install Django on the Development System.

1. Create a Virtual Environment ```virtual-env YOURENVNAME``` and...
2. ...activate it ```source YOURENVNAME/bin/active```.
3. Install required packages into the new venv (pip recommended) ```pip install Django Pillow```
4. Create a Django Project ```django-admin startproject YOURNAME```
5. clone the repository into the new Django project ```git clone URL-TO-THIS-REPO```
6. Modify _settings.py_ by add ```imagegen``` to your ```INSTALLED_APPS```
7. Add ```url(r'^', include('imagegen.urls')),``` to your _urls.py_
8. start the development-server ```./manage.py runserver```


Done: App can be reached at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

If you want to run this on a public server READ DJANGO'S DOCUMENTATION! Also, I highly recommend any sort of caching mechanism if you're going to run this and expect some load. But anyways READ THE DJANGO-DOCS ;-)


## Usage

### Image Size

http://hostname/`WIDTH`

http://hostname/`WIDTH`x`HEIGHT`

Note: `HEIGHT` is always optional and defaults to `WIDTH`.

#### Example
_http://hostname/300_ will give you a 300x300px sized PNG

_http://hostname/800x600_ will give you a 800x600px sized PNG

### Colors

#### Text Color:
http://hostname/WIDTHxHEIGHT/`HEXCOL`

`HEXCOL` can be any 6-digit hex color number formatted in RRGGBB.

#### Background Color:

`HEXCOL` can be any 6-diget hex color number formatted in RRGGBB.
